     Long +

     Blob ~ ( Not a specific Mongo blob type ; We can use binary blocks, or strings)
     Clob ~ ( Not a specific Mongo clob type ; We can use binary blocks, or strings)
     Byte ~ (Mongo lacks a single byte/char type (or even short). String or int32 to map?)
     Char ~ (Mongo lacks a single byte/char type (or even short). String or int32 to map?)
     Date ~  (Mongo does not have a specific DATE type; we must use a Timestamp; including time w/ date)

     Float + (Doubles + floats both map to a Mongo double which is  [8 bytes - 64-bit iee 754 floating point])
     Int +
     Long +
     Short - ( There is no specific short type for mongoâ€¦.)
     String +
     Time - (Mongo lacks a "time only component" type and I see no easy way to fudge it)
     Timestamp +
     Unit ~ (Not sure what the type mapping to mongo of Unit would be?)
     UUID +
     BigDecimal - (this is a tricky one, mongo really doesn't support BigDecimal safely. I'll talk to Rose Toomey [salat] and see how she is solving it these days) - not supported by relational profile ... Throw unsupported exception
