ScalaQuery is a type-safe database query API for Scala.

It includes the following features:
- Simple session management based on JDBC Connections
- Type-safe queries based on a query monad and combinators
- Simple static and dynamic queries

See <http://szeiger.de/blog/2008/12/21/a-type-safe-database-query-dsl-for-scala/>
for an introduction. Some details have changed since then so don't expect the
code from that article to run unmodified with the current version. See
